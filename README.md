# CS 245 (Fall 2018) Practice Assignment 09

See assignment details on Canvas.

A previous version of my code used recursion to sift up and down in the tree. The runtime sometimes went over
the desired 20ms, so I decided to rewrite the functions using while loops instead. This way the runtime was faster
than with recursion. Though personally I like recursion better, I realize that in the long run, it is less
efficient than using loops.
